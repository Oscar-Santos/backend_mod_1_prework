# Exercise 5: More Variables and Printing

name = 'Zed A. Shaw'
age = 35
height = 74 * 2.54    # (* 2.54 to get centimeters)
weight = 180 * 0.45   # (* 0.45 to get kilograms)
eyes = 'Blue'
teeth = 'White'
hair = 'Brown'

puts "Let's talk about #{name}."
puts "He's #{height} centimeters tall."
puts "He's #{weight} kilograms heavy."
puts "Actually that's not too heavy."
puts "He's got #{eyes} eyes and #{hair} hair."
puts "His teeth are usually #{teeth} depending on the coffee."

puts "If I add #{age}, #{height}, and #{weight} I get #{age + height + weight}."

STUDY DRILLS:

1) Change all the variables so there is no my_ in front of each one.

2) Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to centimeters and kilograms.
