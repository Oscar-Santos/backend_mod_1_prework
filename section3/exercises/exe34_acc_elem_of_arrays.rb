# Exercise 34: Accessing Elements of Arrays


# Study Drills


# 1) With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers, can you explain why the year 2010 in "January 1, 2010," really is 2010 and not 2009? (Hint: you can't pick years at random.)

# I would say the year 2010 is really 2010 and not 2009, because we need a 2009 year in order to have a 2010 year, in a way we cannot pick ramdom years for a calendar date.

# 2) Write some more arrays and work out similar indexes until you can translate them.
# 3) Use Ruby to check your answers.
veggies = ["tomatoe", "onion", "garlic", "cilantro", "pepper", "cucumber", "broccoli", "carrot"]

# find the veggies at 1
p veggies[1]
# find the 2nd veggies
p veggies[1]
# find the veggies at 3
p veggies[3]
# find the 1st veggies
p veggies[0]
# find the 4th veggies
p veggies[3]
# find the veggies at 4
p veggies[4]
